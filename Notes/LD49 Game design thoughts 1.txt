LD49 - Unstable reboot.
This is not fun - why.
	- Camera is wrong, Should be first person
		- FPS
	- AI just chases.  Would like AI to chase offset of where I am
	- AI stops chasing when it looses sight of me - should go to last known location.
	- Points -> Win State
	- Powerups -> Catch the ghosts, faster,bonus points
	
	-> What is the core loop?
	-> What is the fun loop?
	-> How can I build parkor into the mechanic?
	
	-> Graphics feels distracting, too monotone, too repetitive.
	-> Graphics does not give a sense of space (location/orientation)
	-> Minimap would be valueable.
	
- Mikes wall level felt better even though the AI sucked.
 - points?
 - climbing up the stair - secret level
 - 360 in air -> how can we add this to a game mechanic?  
	Powerup respawn in midair?
