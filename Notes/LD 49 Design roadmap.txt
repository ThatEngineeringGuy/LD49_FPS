LD49 Design roadmap

//////////////////////////////////////
//  Timeline						//
//////////////////////////////////////

Oct 1-3 - original LD49 game built. 3rd party spline libary added 1GB.
	Posted to itch. 
	Not happy. 1GB package exceeds amount needed for this type of project.
	
Oct 4-10 - Reworked the project to remove dependency on spline library.
		Project dropped to 200MB.
		Lost fun elements
		- Need to reimplement pickups (easy)
		- Color scheeme feels harsher and less organic.  
		-> AI is working! It is still braindead, but it works. 
			- replaced spline package BSP meshes with static meshes from Blender.
			
Oct 17 - Looked at using Github to store project. 

Future work
1) Finish Unreal Ninja course [Done]
	- Saving and loading 
	- Blueprints and gameplay

2) Finish Game - job hunting workshop [Done]
-> Building a portfolio [Done].
	- Dig up Unity games (Bring home bacon, There goes the neighborhood, motor simulator)
		[mostly done, missing motor simulator]
 	- Do I still have the blockout varient?
		[Not started]

3) Practice skills
	- Mesh generatation in blender - refine graphics
	- Work with AI, make 4 varients 
	- UMG for player feedback. [done - basics]
	- Scene/level transitions - opening scene, credits, win/lose
	
4) A complete game
	[Not started]
	- 4 varients of AI.
	[https://medium.com/@alexandre.lombard_91611/ue4-ai-perception-senses-and-stimuli-source-651d84d4d4f3]
	- win/loss states + player feedback
	[In progress]
	- Simple HUD
	[In progress]
	- Player takes damage from ghost mechanic.
	[Not started]
	- Player deals damage to ghost mechanic.
	
5) Added music for background
	Need credits for Incompetech - Kevin MacCloud
	Need credits screen or popup window...
	If popup, how can I tie it to the cue.
	If credits, tie to win/lose state and a menu system - not implemented yet.

//  Project Goals					//
//////////////////////////////////////

Mike really likes this project, so I would like to use that 
as a motivating point to apply knowledge of unreal.  
As this is my one of my first non-tutorial project in Unreal,
 - I want to keep the concept and scope simple.
 - Integrate knowledge 
 - Focus on finding the fun, so that I will want to keep developing this project. 
 - Learn how to modify the basic AI that was implemented.
 
Working through the Unreal Ninja course.  
 - Apply savegame blueprints.
 - Increase comfort with blueprints overall - particulary AI.
 - Using shapekeys/morph targets didn't work.  
 - But I would still like to find a way to create maze creation tools.

//	Challenges						//
//////////////////////////////////////

Challenge: needs to be more fun.
Ideas:
[pending] - do the pac man points pickups.  These were in the original LD49 game and provided immediate goals.
[in progress] - Player takes damage/player deals damage to ghost mechanic.
[pending] - When are you in danger vs in control
[???] - How can skill affect the situation (do you have efficacy and agency)
 
 
 
Challenge: game feel - camera clipping.
 - The camera is clipping into the walls too much which is distracting to game feel.
 - Could make the map more open
	- Mike wants to create a new map -let him
	- scale up all the geometry - no, make a new level
	- remove walls and make the map simpler - no, make a new level.

** - could change camera to FPS
	- I want to vary camera from FPS, to 3rd person, to minimap
		-third person controller has much of executable function.
	- game was based on 3rd person template - 
	- HTF do I? Change Cameras in Unreal Engine 4 Blueprints
	- https://youtu.be/uW86ZGxesmc
	

Challenge: game feel
 - Think about goals and feedback.
	[Done] - Short term goals - get the power points
	[Pending]- Medium term goals - get power ups that let you beat the ghosts.
	[Pending]- long term goals - build a level system.  Ghost speed increases by level.


[Pending]
Challenge: core game mechanic 
 - Core mechanic of pac man is chase, scatter, and flee.
	A) Chase player
	B) Scatter back to spawn point.  then apply simple AI to loop around nearby object.
	C) Flee - player can kill them - run. 
 - Right now the AI only does chase - badly.
	1) Need to modify each ghost to have an AI varient.
	A) Ahead of player
	B) Behind player
	C) Directly at player
	D) (Clyde) the combination of C position and player.
 - collect all power points to win the level
	- this was the nitroglycerin formula from LD game.
	- See original thoughts for pickup ideas. 
 - Pac man implemented the center teleporter for player 
	- I don't recall ghosts following player through this.  
	- they might wander through it, but not follow. 


Challenge: Player feedback - HUD
 - think about HUD design.
	[Done] - points remaining on screen
	[Done] - score
	[Pending] - AI state - chase/scatter/flee tells for the player.


Challenge: Audio cues
 - chomp a power point.
 - Movement
 - proximity of ghosts (tempo change? or sound)
 - time remaining on power pellets - do I want to flash the HUD as warning?
 [Done] - background music
 
[Pending]
Challenge: save and load
 - See https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/onlinelearning-courses/blueprint-runtime-saving-and-loading
 - Features save and load systems
 - High scores, best time
 - Save on exit
 - Save on lose focus (How?)
 - How do I save when computer shuts down? -> Save points at level, restore to last level.
 
 
Challenge: Mike likes the jump and parcore mechanisms that allow for evading the ghosts by getting off the nav mesh.
 - Do I want to fix it.  
 - Should it be a player feature?
 - How would this play out in multiplayer.
 - Current AI still rushes the player even when off nav mesh.


[Pending]
Challenge: Mini-map
 - was able to implement in Unity.  
 - How do you do a second camera with a different renderer?


[Do not implement] 
Challenge: Multiplayer
 - Needs consideration. 
 - Coop mode.
 - Server replicaiton - Future work, this project might work for it.
